These systems include, but are not limited to signature systems, data normalization algorithms, and computational proof systems.\r\n\r\n### Specification\r\n\r\nThe group is currently incubating, implementing, and deploying the following specifications:\r\n\r\n* [Linked Data Signatures](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/) - Describes a mechanism for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of linked data documents using digital signatures.\r\n* [2016 RSA Signature Suite](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-rsa2016/) - Signature Suite for RSA 2016.\r\n* [2016 Koblitz Elliptic Curve Suite](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-koblitz2016/) - Signature Suite for the Koblitz Elliptic Curve 2016.\r\n* [2016 Redaction Signature Suite](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-redaction2016/) - Signature Suite created in 2016 for performing Redacted signatures.\r\n* [2016 Pseudonymous Signature Suite](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-pseudonymous2016/) - Signature Suite for Pseudonymous 2016 signatures.\r\n",
